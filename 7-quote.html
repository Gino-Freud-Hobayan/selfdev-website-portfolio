  <br>   It's about what you're made of, not the circumstances."

  <br><br>
  I really like this quote as it perfectly represents what growth mindset is, 
  <br> and because I am both the egg and the potato.

  <br><br>
  I'm not perfect and I'm not where I want to be yet, but I know that I can always grow and improve.
  <br><br>

  Sometimes I'm the egg, because what doesn't kill me only makes me stronger.
  <br>
  Sometimes I'm the potato, some challenges are just too big for me to handle and I crumble.

  <br><br> 
  When life puts me in the boiling water, I always strive to do my best to adapt and harden like the egg.

  <br><br>
  In order to be like the egg, I only focus on what I can control, and that is the present. 
  <br>
  I cannot change the past and the future is built one day at a time.
