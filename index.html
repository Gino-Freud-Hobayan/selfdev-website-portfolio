    <h2>Gino Freud D. Hobayan</h2>

    <p>  <strong> I'm Gino Freud D. Hobayan</strong>, a first year computer science student at CIIT College of Arts and Technology.

        <br> <br>
        Before becoming a student at CIIT, I started working overseas at the age of 19 as a Seafarer 
        and eventually became a licensed merchant marine officer,
        but because of a massive external variable that was beyond my control (COVID-19), 
        I had to find a new job here in the Philippines. I worked in Sales during the pandemic 
        and I was able to earn and learn a lot about sales, marketing, branding, and personal finance.

        <br> <br> 
        It was hard since I was quiet, introverted, and didn't really have a big network.
        Working in that industry was hard but not impossible, so I worked hard and I was able to develop my skills, maintained a growth mindset, 
        and through my efforts and persistence, I was able to grow and survive in this challenging environment.



        <br> <br> 
        While working in sales I spent my free time learning SQL, Python, and Microsoft Excel.
        <br> I made my own portfolio and I eventually got a short internship as a data analyst but realized that I still lack a lot of skills
        and knowledge in this field, and that led me here to CIIT.
