    <h2> Stress and Conflict Management: </h2>

    1. <b>Focusing on what I can control</b>
      <br><br>

    2. <b>Engaging in escapism</b> - We all need a little bit of fiction to survive the non-fiction
          <br>(Playing games, watching shows, movies, etc.)  
    <br><br>


    3. <b>Eat the Frog time management technique</b> - dealing with the biggest obstacle first thing in the morning
    <br> while my decision making abilities are still fresh and sharp.

      <br><br>


      <h2> Reflection: </h2>

    Tracking my activities for an entire week made me more aware on how I actually spend my 24 hours a day. 
    <br>
    How much time I spend being productive, engaging in escapism, and how much time I spend on other activities.
    <br>
    And that's a good thing because awareness is the first step in the problem solving process. 
    <br>
    You cannot solve if you're not aware that a problem exists.
    <br>
