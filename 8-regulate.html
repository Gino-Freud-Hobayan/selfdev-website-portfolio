  <h2>Deliverable 3 - Trigger Tracker Poster</h2>

  <h3> 

<p style="color: #58a6ff;">
1. Trigger: Failure </p> 
Adopt a growth mindset
<br>"Why am I being punished" to "What actions can I do now"
<br>Don't make the same mistake twice, learn from it, and do better next time.

<br><br>


<p style="color: #58a6ff;">
2. Trigger: Being compared to others </p>

Stay on your own lane and focus on your own progress.
<br> "What ultimately matters in this course is not so much 
where you end up relative to your classmates 
but where you end up relative to yourself when you began"
<br><br>


<p style="color: #58a6ff;">
3. Trigger: Betrayal </p>
Focus on what you can control and you have to be your own superman and save yourself.
<br> Don't let a single bad apple spoil the whole batch, 
find a way to trust other people again 
<br> because not everybody is out to get you.
